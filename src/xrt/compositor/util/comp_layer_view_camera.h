 * @file
 * @brief  Per-view camera selection and the shared layer-composition policy.
 * @author David Fattal
 * @ingroup comp_util
 *
 * Two things live here, and both for the same reason: the answer must not
 * depend on which backend is asking.
 *
 *  1. the per-view CAMERA every layer type is projected through (#1580), and
 *  2. the composition POLICY a renderer applies once it has that camera —
 *     eye visibility (@ref is_layer_view_visible_n), quad facing
 *     (@ref comp_layer_quad_is_front_facing, #1590), the src/dst blend rule
 *     (@ref comp_layer_blend_mode, #1599) and the painter's-order first-layer
 *     gate (@ref comp_layer_tile_blend_mode, #1598/#1600).
 *
 * Every one of them is a PREDICATE the renderer consults, never a pipeline
 * state it inherits — see comp_layer_quad_is_front_facing() for why facing in
 * particular cannot be rasterizer culling here.
 *
 * #1580 — THE INVARIANT: one camera per view per frame, shared by every layer
 * type. That camera is the {pose, fov} pair `xrLocateViews` handed the app,
 * expressed in the compositor's layer frame; because the projection layer is
 * drawn as an identity-MVP fullscreen blit, the view tile IS that frustum, so
 * quad / cylinder / equirect / cube layers must be projected through the SAME
 * one or their world pose lands on different display pixels than the
 * projection content at that pose.
 *
 * THE LAYER FRAME is the head device's TRACKING-ORIGIN ("root") space
 * (#1594/#1607). `handle_space()` in oxr_session_frame_end.c resolves EVERY
 * layer pose — `data.quad.pose` and `data.proj.v[i].pose` alike — into it
 * through one call on the head device, VIEW reference spaces included (the
 * #1502 eye-centroid offset rides along as that locate's base offset). So a
 * projection layer's per-view pose, and the frame cameras the state tracker
 * carries on @ref xrt_layer_frame_data, need no re-basing.
 *
 * What DOES need re-basing is the display processor's eye: the DP reports eyes
 * relative to the head (the display plane), so branch (b) below lifts one into
 * the layer frame with `xrt_layer_frame_data::head_pose` (`T_root_head`). Before
 * #1594 the layer frame WAS head-relative and no lift was needed; a branch-(b)
 * camera left head-relative today puts VIEW quads right and LOCAL quads a whole
 * head pose wrong.
 *
 * This lives in comp_util (Vulkan-free, C) so every backend — D3D11, D3D12,
 * Metal, GL, vk_native — consumes ONE implementation instead of each renderer
 * inventing a camera.

 *      composed beside it must use the same one even if the frame also carries
 *      cameras.
 *  (b') else, the frame's own cameras on `accum->data` (@ref
 *      xrt_layer_frame_data::cameras), when `cameras_valid`. These are what

 *      right when the session runs a camera-centric rig (the qwerty default,
 *      or a chained XR_DXR_view_rig), whose frustum is a fixed vFOV sheared by
 *      the convergence and has no relation to the panel's Kooima frustum.
 *  (b) else, if an eye position and a canvas size are known → identity
 *      orientation at @p eye_pos, FOV from `dxr_display3d_compute_fov()`,
 *      the whole pose then lifted out of head-relative space into the layer
 *      frame by `accum->data.head_pose` (#1594). A best-effort DISPLAY-centric
 *      reconstruction, kept for callers with no frame data (and for a session
 *      whose locate had no valid pose bits yet).
 *  (c) else the legacy placeholder camera ({∓0.032, 0, 0}, symmetric ±0.785
 *      rad) plus one process-lifetime U_LOG_W naming the fallback. Never
 *      logged per frame.
 *
 * @param accum      The frame's accumulated layers (may be NULL → skip (a)).

 * The full-fidelity entry point: takes the DP's WHOLE per-view eye set plus the
 * frame's ACTIVE view count, and derives branch (b)'s render eye with exactly
 * the two rules the state tracker applies before it computes the pose and FOV
 * it hands the app at `xrLocateViews`. Both rules are invisible to a caller
 * that only has a left/right pair, and both make the compositor's camera
 * disagree with the located view when they bite:
 *
 *  - **Mono collapse.** When the active rendering mode has ONE view but the DP
 *    still reports N >= 2 eyes, the render eye is the CENTROID of that set, not
 *    eye 0. Pairing the centred pose oxr reports with eye 0's off-axis frustum
 *    is the 2D lateral shift of modelviewer#100; the collapse lives in
 *    `oxr_session_locate_views()` (oxr_session.c, the `active_view_count == 1`
 *    branch) in-process and in `ipc_try_get_sr_view_poses()`
 *    (ipc_server_handler.c, #521/#575) over IPC. This is its compositor twin.
 *
 *  - **Per-view eyes, surplus views clamped.** View i renders from eye i, not
 *    from a left/right pair — a 4-view (2x2 quad) mode has four DISTINCT eyes,
 *    two of them a full 64 mm apart vertically. Views past the reported eye
 *    count reuse the LAST eye, which is the same surplus-slot rule the state
 *    tracker's #615 eye-set coherence guard applies.
 *
 * @param eyes              The DP's per-view eye set, relative to the HEAD
 *                          device (nullable / count 0 -> skip (b)).
 * @param active_view_count The active rendering mode's view count; 0 means
 *                          "same as @p eyes->count" (no collapse).
 *
 * @warning The return value is a diagnostic, not a validity flag — see
 *          @ref comp_layer_view_camera_select. A NULL / empty eye set only
 *          skips branch (b); @p out is still populated and must still be

/*!
 * The blend mode for the next layer into a tile, and mark the tile painted.
 *
 * THE FIRST layer composited into a tile is a @ref COMP_LAYER_BLEND_REPLACE,
 * whatever its flags say, and only later layers blend per
 * @ref comp_layer_blend_mode. That gate is flag-INDEPENDENT on purpose:
 * transparent-background apps set `SOURCE_ALPHA_BIT` on their SINGLE
 * projection layer (every `cube_handle_*`, every `cube_zones_*`), and the
 * shaped / compose-under contract requires that first blit to be a replace so
 * the app's alpha reaches the atlas verbatim (#225). Blending it over the
 * clear instead would drive `dst.a` to 1 everywhere and silently kill the
 * display processor's alpha gate. As a side effect the single-layer frame
 * every shipping app submits keeps exactly the state it has today.
 *
 * Nothing is under the first layer but the clear, so REPLACE is also what the
 * spec's painter's algorithm reduces to there. An unflagged LATER layer is a
 * @ref COMP_LAYER_BLEND_OPAQUE_COVER, not a second REPLACE: it must raise
 * `dst.a` to one where it draws, which is the whole reason the two modes are
 * distinct.
 *
 * KNOWN DEVIATIONS, both in the in-process D3D11 renderer and both deliberate:
 * its painter's-order loop covers the KHRONOS layer types only (Local2D /
 * window-space is a runtime-owned 2D channel drawn in a later pass with its
 * own blend rule), and a 3D-zone layer paints a sub-rect rather than a cover,
 * so it marks the tile composited but bypasses this gate and keeps its own
 * ADR-027 alpha-over rule.
 *
 * THE D3D11 SERVICE carries the same two, plus three of its own — it composes
 * a client's frame in TWO passes on different mechanisms, not one loop:
 *
 *  - PROJECTION-CLASS LAYERS ARE A SEPARATE, EARLIER PASS. That pass owns the
 *    cross-process keyed-mutex acquire, the zero-copy decision and the
 *    content-dims record, so it cannot simply be folded into the layer loop.
 *    It applies this gate among ITSELF (submission-ordered, first one in is
 *    the REPLACE), and the UI pass then seeds each tile COMPOSITED when the
 *    frame carried one. What is lost is the cross-pass order: a projection
 *    layer submitted AFTER a quad still composites BEFORE it, so it cannot
 *    cover it.
 *  - A LATER UNFLAGGED PROJECTION LAYER GETS NO ALPHA-OF-ONE. Its pass blits
 *    through a shader with no colour-scale/bias channel to fold
 *    @ref comp_layer_blend_fold_opaque_cover into, so OPAQUE_COVER degrades to
 *    the verbatim cover it shares colour with. Visible only as atlas alpha, in
 *    a transparent session, on a frame with two or more projection layers.
 *  - LOCAL2D / WINDOW-SPACE IS LATER STILL: not a later pass over the client's
 *    own atlas but a later STAGE, `multi_compositor_render()`, which blits it
 *    onto the COMBINED atlas. Its per-client tile blit maps an unflagged
 *    client to REPLACE rather than OPAQUE_COVER on purpose: that blit is the
 *    base of the client's region, not a layer stacked over one, so its alpha
 *    must reach the combined atlas verbatim (#225).
 *
 * @param tile        This view's tile state; NULL means "treat as first".
 * @param layer_flags @ref xrt_layer_data::flags.
