 * #918 output-device split. On a non-MUX hybrid the panel is scanned out by the
 * iGPU while the app renders on the dGPU, so today's placement pays ~42 ms of
 * present-to-display and re-crosses the whole woven frame on every repaint tick
 * (docs/investigations/hybrid-igpu-weave.md). The split moves the target, the
 * display processor, the HUD and the repaint loop onto the SCANOUT adapter and
 * ships only the atlas across, once per app frame.
 *
 * **DEFAULT ON since #918 Phase 3** (ADR-037 §1): the split is not a mode to opt
 * into, it is what the placement rule degenerates to whenever render and scanout
 * differ. `DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT=0` is the kill switch; `=1` still works and is
 * now a no-op restatement of the default.
 *
 * Silent no-op when the scanout adapter IS the app's adapter; any setup failure
 * falls back to the stock single-device path with one WARN naming the reason —
 * it must never brick a session.
 *
 * NOTE the parser: `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION` uses `debug_string_to_bool`,
 * which is NOT the leading-character test `comp_split_gate_env_requested` uses.

 * avoid that today by clipping at the plane and throwing all rear depth away.
 * The conflict is only visible over a background with HORIZONTAL luminance
 * structure, so the runtime watches the desktop the DP already captures and
 * hands the app a budget instead of a blanket rule.
 *
 * Everything that is NOT the typed vtable call lives in comp_rear_budget:
 * preview validation, the re-analyse-only-when-the-generation-advanced rule,
 * the policy tick, the publish, and the DXR_REAR_BUDGET_DUMP PNG. What stays
 * here is the D3D11 slot itself — the one part that cannot be shared.
 *
 * Cost control: the DP produces the preview on its own capture throttle
 * (<= 15 Hz), we ask at most every 66 ms, and we only ANALYSE when the
 * generation advanced. A frame where nothing moved costs one vtable call.

		 * NEGOTIATION, and a weaver-creation failure on the scanout adapter as
		 * a FALLBACK TRIGGER — never a session that survives without a weave,
		 * which on a 3D panel is a flat or black picture and is strictly worse
		 * than the rung-2 fallback the ADR mandates.
		 *
		 * So the negotiation is the LAST of Stage A's commit criteria, and it
		 * happens HERE rather than at the stock display-processor site three
		 * hundred lines below, which is after the point of no return: by then
		 * the target, its RTVs and the repaint loop have all been built on the
		 * out device and there is nothing left to fall back INTO. Asking first
		 * means a refusal is just another Stage-A failure, and the existing,
		 * well-tested teardown-and-fall-through below is the whole recovery —
		 * no retire function, no half-built state to unwind, no second recovery
		 * path to drift from the first.
		 *
		 * NO WEAVER CAN BE STRANDED ON THE HWND. One weaver per HWND, and this
		 * is the compositor's single creation point (@ref d3d11_make_dp):
		 *   - it SUCCEEDS  -> `c->display_processor` is the one the session
		 *                     goes on to use; the stock site below sees it
		 *                     already set and does not call the factory again;
		 *   - it DECLINES  -> nothing was created (the factory returned no
		 *                     object, or the test arm never called it), Stage A
		 *                     fails, and the stock site creates the DP on the
		 *                     app device against a window that holds none.
		 * Nothing after this point in Stage A can fail, so a created weaver is
		 * never orphaned by a later step; the teardown below destroys it anyway
		 * so that stays true if a step is ever added.

/*!
 * #918 Phase 2a — a REGION-SIZED output-device view of a bridge plane, for the
 * DP sideband entry points that take dims but no uv scale.
 *
 * Three properties the first cut did not have:
 *
 * - **Passthrough when the plane already IS the requested extent.** No texture,
 *   no copy, no bytes. That is now the mask publish's normal path, because the
 *   authored-mask plane is sized at the mask (#918 review F5).
 * - **SEQ-GATED (#918 review F8).** The copy re-runs only when the slot's plane
 *   generation differs from the one the view already holds. An unchanged
 *   backdrop under a forced repaint copies NOTHING; the old code re-copied a
 *   full 4K region on every weave AND every repaint tick, which at panel rate is
 *   GB/s of output-device traffic that no meter could see.
 * - **CLAMPED and METERED.** The box is min(src, dst) — an oversized
 *   `CopySubresourceRegion` is silently DROPPED by D3D11, which would have left
 *   a vendor sampling an uninitialised texture (#918 review F6) — and the bytes
 *   land in the DIAG line.
 *
 * Returns NULL on any failure, which the callers already treat as "no backdrop"
 * / "keep the previous publish" — a degraded feature, never a broken frame.
 *
 * @param content_seq The plane generation @p plane_srv carries, from the slot's
 *        recipe. 0 means "unknown", which forces the copy.
