# ADR-021: Color Management & the Encoding-State Invariant

## Context

The runtime's color handling grew ad-hoc — each compositor path adopted whatever
colorspace strategy fit the apps it happened to meet. The recent sRGB/gamma fixes
([#407](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/pull/407) GL,
[#408](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/pull/408) D3D11/D3D12/VK/Metal)
corrected a real ~2.2×-too-dark bug in the in-process path, but the investigation
([#409](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/issues/409)) showed the three
paths each encode a *different* convention, and that one of them carries the same
half-conversion #407 fixed — latent only because no shipping app exercises it.

There was no written contract for what colorspace state a texture holds at each hop,
so every fix was reactive — and worse, the reactive fixes were tuned to what one
vendor's display processor happened to want. That inverts DisplayXR's core
dependency direction: **the runtime defines vendor-neutral conventions; the display
processor adapts to them** (ADR-003, ADR-007, ADR-019). This ADR establishes the
color contract on those terms.

### The bug class, generalized

A texture holds pixels in one of two **encoding states**:

- **Linear** (scene-referred / radiance) — proportional to light. Blending, filtering,
  MSAA resolve, and mipmap generation are *only correct here*.
- **Encoded** (display-referred, sRGB/gamma) — in the standard display transfer
  function; what a display physically wants.

A texture's **format declares which**: a `*_SRGB` format ⟹ encoded (the GPU
auto-decodes on sample, auto-encodes on render-target write); a UNORM / float format
⟹ linear. Every bug we chased was the same shape — a **half-conversion**: a decode
(format said sRGB) with no matching encode, or vice versa.

## Decision

### 1. The matched-pair invariant (the central rule)

> **Colorspace conversions come in matched pairs (decode … encode) or not at all
> (passthrough) — never half.**

This is path-independent and model-independent. Any place that decodes (samples an sRGB
SRV, calls a `srgb_to_linear`) must have a corresponding encode before the bytes leave
for the next canonical space, or it must not decode at all.

### 2. Standard transfer function; no vendor curves in the runtime

The canonical encoded state is **standard sRGB**. The runtime's compositor/shader code
must never use a vendor-specific transfer function. The existing
`linear_to_srgb()` in `d3d11_service_shaders.h` bakes a vendor-specific power-law curve
into shared runtime code — a vendor-isolation violation; it is to be removed. If a
vendor's panel needs a non-sRGB curve, that mapping lives **inside that vendor's DP**,
applied after the runtime hands off standard bytes.

When a path does decode/encode, **both sides of the pair use the same (sRGB) curve.**
Pairing an sRGB decode with a different-curve encode is a half-broken round-trip
(persistent tint), not a clean one.

### 3. Two canonical spaces; the DP-handoff space is *declared by the DP*

```
app render → [swapchain] → sample → [compose / atlas] → process_atlas() → panel
                         ^^^^^^^               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                      COMPOSE space          DP-HANDOFF space
```

- **Compose space** is DisplayXR-internal and vendor-neutral (model choice in §5).
- **DP-handoff space is a negotiated contract, not a fixed value.** Two declarations
  define it:
  1. **DP capability (static):** the DP declares which encoding state(s) it can accept —
     `LINEAR`, `ENCODED`, or `EITHER`.
  2. **Runtime intent (per-frame):** the runtime declares the encoding state of the atlas
     it is actually sending via a dedicated `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR|ENCODED)` call made
     immediately before `process_atlas()`. (This is conveyed out-of-band, *not* by
     overloading the `process_atlas` `format` argument: that argument turned out **not** to
     be dead — some DPs feed it straight to their weaver's `setInputViewTexture` as the real
     texture format — so it stays the real format and the encoding rides a separate,
     append-only vtable slot. See *Consequences*.)

  The runtime guarantees it sends an encoding the DP can accept; if its compose space
  doesn't match a capability-restricted DP, the runtime converts compose→accepted as a
  matched-pair step before handoff. The DP then guarantees panel-correct (encoded) output
  to the display, converting internally as needed.

  This is the key correction over a naive "handoff = encoded" rule, which was
  reverse-engineered from one vendor's weaver. A future vendor whose weaver consumes only
  linear input declares `LINEAR`; one that consumes only encoded declares `ENCODED`; the
  runtime serves both with no compositor change.

### 4. DPs that accept `EITHER` make the contract cheap

A display processor whose weaver exposes an explicit input/output sRGB-conversion control
(decode-before-weave and/or encode-after-weave) can accept **`EITHER`** encoding *and*
perform the final output encode itself — the encoding is selected by an API knob, not
inferred from the texture format. This is the common case for production weavers, and it
collapses the boundary problem:

- The runtime sends its **native compose space** to such a DP and never converts at the
  boundary; the DP configures its weaver to match the runtime's per-frame declaration:
  - atlas **encoded** → weave as-is, output encoded (today's behavior), or decode→weave
    in linear→re-encode.
  - atlas **linear** → weave in linear (correct blend/sampling math) and **encode on
    output**. The matched encode lives in the DP's weaver, so the runtime needs **no
    encode shader** for Model B.
- This is why deleting `linear_to_srgb()` from the runtime (§2) is not just legal but
  correct: the encode belongs in the DP.

For an `EITHER`-capable DP, the runtime's A-vs-B choice (§5) is purely an internal
correctness decision with **zero** boundary-conversion cost. The concrete control
exposed by a given vendor's weaver is documented under that vendor's docs
(`docs/vendors/<vendor>/`), never here.

### 5. Compose-space model: Model A baseline, Model B sanctioned future

The compose-space encoding is an **internal** DisplayXR decision about compositing
correctness, now decoupled from whatever any DP wants:

- **Model A (baseline, today):** compose in **encoded** space (passthrough). Apps in
  this ecosystem write display-referred bytes into both sRGB and UNORM swapchains, so
  passthrough is the coherent baseline. The in-process path is already here (post
  #407/#408); the service/workspace path must drop the unmatched decode on its
  sRGB-client branch (use the UNORM SRV / raw bytes). Until then that branch is guarded
  with a one-shot warning in `multi_compositor_render`.
- **Model B (sanctioned future):** compose in **linear** space — decode iff sRGB →
  compose linear → convert to the DP's declared handoff state. This is the *correct*
  model for alpha compositing, premultiplied-alpha math, and the compose-under-background
  transparency feature, all wrong in non-linear space.

  Key property: **B degenerates to A (passthrough) wherever there is nothing to blend**
  (decode-then-immediately-reconvert is the identity). So B only costs more on the
  **workspace/service compose path** where surfaces overlap — exactly where the
  transparency feature lives. It is gated on that feature needing correct blending.

### 6. Format is the source of truth for a swapchain's encoding state

`*_SRGB` ⟺ encoded; UNORM / float ⟺ linear. This requires apps to declare honestly
(request an sRGB swapchain and store correctly-encoded pixels). Some test apps violate
this today (encoded bytes in UNORM swapchains); see *Consequences*.

## Consequences

- **Vendor isolation preserved.** Color conventions are DisplayXR's; the DP adapts via
  a declaration. Adding a vendor with a different input-encoding need requires zero
  compositor changes — only the DP declares its preference.
- **Two new append-only DP-vtable slots** (ADR-020: `struct_size`-gated, **absent ⟹
  `ENCODED`** so older plug-ins keep their passthrough behavior):
  1. `get_handoff_color_capability()` — the DP's static accepted encoding (`LINEAR` /
     `ENCODED` / `EITHER`). Production weavers with a configurable conversion control
     declare **`EITHER`**.
  2. `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR|ENCODED)` — the runtime's per-frame intent, called just
     before `process_atlas()`. It is a *separate* slot rather than a `process_atlas`
     argument because the `format` argument is **not** dead in practice — some weavers
     consume it as the real input-texture format — so it stays the real format and the
     encoding rides out-of-band. Both slots are append-only ⟹ **no ABI major bump**, and
     the change is back-compatible in both directions (old-runtime+new-plug-in and
     new-runtime+old-plug-in both fall to Model A).
- **Vendor DP work (per-vendor, in each plug-in repo):** a vendor whose weaver supports
  configurable conversion should (1) wire that control to the runtime's declared atlas
  encoding (encode on output whenever input is linear), (2) expose it for **every
  graphics-API variant** it ships, and (3) declare its capability. Concrete per-vendor
  steps live in that vendor's docs, not in this ADR.
- **One rule for all paths.** "Is this path balanced?" becomes a mechanical check
  against the per-hop encoding table — and a regression test, not a code review.
- **The latent service-path bug is documented and guarded**, with a defined fix: under
  Model A, passthrough the sRGB-SRV branch; the conversion-to-handoff machinery (§4) is
  what ultimately replaces the ad-hoc branch.
- **Vendor curve removed.** `linear_to_srgb()` (a vendor power-law) is deleted from
  runtime shaders; any panel curve is DP-internal.
- **App colorspace contract becomes load-bearing.** Honest declaration is required for
  Model B; a transitional per-app `treat-as-encoded` override is the escape hatch for
  legacy/test apps that put encoded bytes in UNORM. Our own test apps should migrate to
  honest sRGB swapchains.
- **Verification gap closed.** The cube test apps gained `DXR_SWAPCHAIN_ENCODING=srgb|unorm`
  + `DXR_TRUE_LINEAR` modes (a true-linear-into-UNORM source), and `sim_display`'s D3D11
  variant declares `EITHER` + encodes on `LINEAR` — the in-repo DP test double for the
  encode-at-handoff direction. Matrix: `{sRGB, UNORM-encoded, true-linear} × {single, multi}
  × {in-process, IPC, workspace}` (`test_apps/COLOR_REGRESSION_MATRIX.md`).
- **HDR / wide-gamut**, if it lands on the roadmap, forces Model B with a float16 linear
  compose space and would move B from "gated future" to "now."

### As shipped (runtime #419 + vendor plug-in)

Model B landed on the **D3D11 workspace/service compose path** with two refinements the
implementation forced:

- **Honest-sRGB gate (load-bearing).** Model B engages only when the DP accepts linear, ≥2
  layers composite, **and every contributing client is a genuine `*_SRGB` swapchain**. A
  UNORM swapchain is ambiguous (encoded-in-UNORM vs already-linear-in-UNORM — the two can't
  be told apart from the format), so UNORM clients stay on Model A passthrough. This is §6
  "format is the source of truth" made operational: only honest-sRGB content is decoded.
- **Runtime chrome + backdrop linearize too.** Under Model B the whole atlas is declared
  `LINEAR`, so everything the *runtime* composites (window chrome, focus glow, cursor, and
  the `#1a1a1a` backdrop clear) — all display-referred — must also be decoded to linear, or
  the DP's single output encode double-encodes them. The blit shader applies the standard
  sRGB decode on every output (content + chrome) and the backdrop is cleared to the linear
  value; the DP performs the one matched encode.
- The mechanism is otherwise as in §3–§5: raw-sample → linear compose → `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR)`
  → the weaver's output encode. In-process paths and UNORM workspaces are unchanged Model A.

### As shipped (vk_native, #1589 + #1610)

The Vulkan compose path takes a third shape that §5's A/B pair does not name,
and it is worth writing down so nobody files it as one of them:

> **Compose in LINEAR, encode at the boundary, hand the DP ENCODED.**

Model B declares the *atlas* linear and leaves the matched encode to the DP.
This does not: the encode happens on store into a runtime-private compose
target (attached through an `_SRGB` view), and the atlas the DP receives is
still encoded, so `set_atlas_encoding` is never called and an un-updated
plug-in is unaffected. It gets Model B's correctness where it matters —
alpha compositing in linear light — **without** the DP-facing contract change,
which is why it can land on a backend whose vendor plug-ins have not moved.

Two consequences of §6 becoming operational here:

- **The format is now believed.** An `_SRGB` source is decoded on sample; a
  UNORM source is read as the linear values the OpenXR spec says it holds
  ("All other formats will be treated as linear values"). The matched encode
  is the attachment's, on store — never a lone decode.
- **Passthrough is no longer universally safe.** The `vkCmdBlitImage` fast
  path is restricted to frames whose source is already `_SRGB`; a UNORM source
  must take the render pass, because passing its linear bytes to an `ENCODED`
  DP renders them far too dark. This is the cost §6 always implied and it
  falls on exactly the apps the migration is moving.

## Encoding state at each hop (current baseline = Model A; DP configured for encoded passthrough)

| Hop | In-process | IPC / service | Workspace / shell |
|---|---|---|---|
| App swapchain | encoded (in sRGB or UNORM) | encoded | encoded |
| Sample into compose | passthrough (UNORM SRV / skip-decode) | passthrough (raw copy) | passthrough (raw copy → TYPELESS atlas) |
| Compose / atlas | encoded | encoded | encoded (UNORM SRV branch) / **linear (sRGB SRV branch — unmatched decode, guarded, to be removed)** |
| Compose → handoff (per DP decl.) | passthrough (DP accepts encoded) | passthrough | passthrough except the sRGB-SRV branch |
| DP handoff | **encoded** ✓ | **encoded** ✓ | **encoded** ✓ except the sRGB-SRV branch |

Under Model B (future) the "Compose / atlas" row becomes **linear** on the
workspace/service path, and the "Compose → handoff" row carries the matched conversion
to whatever the DP declared (encode-to-sRGB for an `ENCODED` DP; passthrough for a
`LINEAR` DP). The in-process row is unchanged (passthrough == A == B with nothing to
blend).
