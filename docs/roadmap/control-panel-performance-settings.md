## The problem, stated precisely

Every runtime performance lever is an **environment variable**. The Control Panel is a
thin, non-elevated SDL+cimgui front-end that shells out to `displayxr-cli` and links
zero runtime code (`src/xrt/targets/control_panel/CMakeLists.txt:5-11`). The runtime
DLL loads into the **app's** process.

Three consequences kill the obvious design:

1. **The panel cannot set an env var for a running app.** Different process; the value
   was latched at first read anyway.
2. **The panel cannot set one for an app it never launches** — and it never launches
   any. The service orchestrator spawns only the workspace controller
   (`service_orchestrator.c`); an app started from Explorer, Steam or the Unity editor
   inherits nothing from the panel.
3. **Even in-process, `getenv` is not what you think.** On Windows it reads the CRT's
   cached environment table; `SetEnvironmentVariableW` does not refresh it. This is
   already documented for `DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` (`adapter-selection.md` §*The `getenv()`
   caveat*) and cost displayxr-unity#243 a native shim.

**Therefore: the only channel that reaches an arbitrary app process is a persisted store
that the runtime DLL reads from inside that process.** Any design phrased as "the panel
sets an env var" is wrong on Windows unless it also says who launches the app.

## How options are read today — three patterns, one seam

| Pattern | Example | Seam? |
|---|---|---|
| `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_*_OPTION` (`u_debug.h:95-166`) → `debug_get_*_option` → **`get_option_raw()`** (`u_debug.c:39-97`) | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION(weave_on_scanout, "DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT", true)` | **Yes** — one function, three platform bodies, covers every macro-based option in every process linking `aux_util` |
| Hand-rolled `static int x = -1; if (x < 0) x = parse(getenv("DXR_…"));` at the call site | `comp_d3d11_target.cpp:43-55`, `comp_split_gate.c:47-55`, `comp_d3d11_service.cpp:19741` | No — bypasses `get_option_raw` entirely. **~2/3 of the perf levers.** |
| A name-taking helper doing property-then-env | `bg2d_int_knob(prop, env, dflt)` (`comp_bg2d.c:190-205`) | Prior art for exactly the shape we want |

Three facts that constrain any redesign:

- **`get_option_raw` has an out-of-process channel on Android**: it reads the
  system property `debug.xrt.<NAME>` rather than the environment (`u_debug.c:66-78`).
  **But it is NOT "already solved" — see the name-length trap below; 34 of the 81
  option knobs are silently unreachable through it.**
- **The parsers are deliberately not unified.** `comp_split_gate.c:20-44` carries an
  explicit note — the leading-character test is *"deliberately NOT
  `debug_string_to_bool`"*. A design that re-parses centrally silently changes
  purpose-built semantics. **The store must supply strings and let each site parse as it
  does today.**
- **`DEBUG_GET_ONCE_*` caches are per translation unit.** `DXR_PRESENT_OPAQUE` has six
  independent caches, `DXR_LATE_WEAVE` five. Harmless for next-launch semantics; fatal
  for any naive "live update" of those names.

## The four tiers

The decisive question is **not** "is the read site on the per-frame path" — most of them
are. It is **what the value is consumed into.**

### Tier 1 — next-launch (the large majority)

The value is baked into an object at creation: an adapter is picked, a device is made, a
thread is spawned, a swapchain `AlphaMode` is set, a `VkInstance` layer list is finalized,
a client cap is sized. Changing these requires a new session, and often a new process.

`DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT` (Stage A stands up a second D3D device,
`comp_d3d11_compositor.cpp:4011`) · `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT` (spawns, or does not spawn, the
repaint thread — `:4450-4463`) · `DXR_VK_QUEUE_MODE` (layer injection at `VkInstance`
create, `oxr_vulkan.c:353`) · `DXR_PRESENT_OPAQUE` (swapchain `AlphaMode`) ·
`DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` / `DXR_VK_FORCE_GPU` (adapter selection) · `DXR_MAX_CLIENTS`
(service start only, `ipc_server_process.c:541-551`) · `DXR_SPLIT_INGRESS` ·
`DXR_APP_HWND_LATENCY` (uncached `getenv`, but consumed at `SetMaximumFrameLatency`) ·
`DXR_VK_DEPOSIT` · `DXR_CMD_QUEUE` · `DXR_COMPOSE_FROM_COPY` · `DXR_LATE_WEAVE`.

### Tier 2 — service-scoped, could be live

Consumed fresh on the service's own render/commit tick; the *only* thing latching them is
a `static … = -1` cache in a process that already runs continuously. Making them live
means deleting the static and reading a service-held snapshot — mechanically cheap.

`DXR_COMMIT_PACE` · `DXR_FENCE_WAIT_MS` · `DXR_EVICT_IDLE_MS` · `DXR_EVICT_ENDED_MS` ·
`DXR_DP_GRAVEYARD_MS` · `DXR_DEVICE_REMOVED_EXIT_MS` · `DXR_HEALTH_MS` ·
`DXR_IDLE_QUIESCE_MS`.

Semantic caveat: `DXR_COMMIT_PACE` changes backpressure discipline; flipping it under a
live client is a behaviour change mid-flight, not just a number change.

### Tier 3 — genuinely live

The honest members are `DXR_LATE_WEAVE_MAX_LATENCY` / `_AUTOBACKOFF`: the governor
(`comp_weave_latency_win.h:167-229`) **already** mutates its `effective` depth at runtime
— only `base` is latched. Plus the pure observers (`DXR_FRAME_WITNESS`,
`DXR_FRAME_STAGE_TIMING`, `DXR_WEAVE_LATENCY_CSV`), which change nothing but logging.

**But an in-process app has no IPC back to the panel.** "Live" in an app process could
only mean polling the store on a cadence. Not recommended for v1. Read Tier 3 as *live in
the service, next-launch in-app*.

### Tier 4 — must never be a toggle

All `DXR_TEST_*` · every `_DIAG` / `_DUMP` / `_PROBE` / `_JIGGLE` / `_REFLATTEN` /
`_DRAIN` / `_NO2D` bisect probe · `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_FORCE` (documented as *"it **will**
cost frame rate"*) · `DXR_SIM_INPUT` (+ `DXR_SIM_INPUT_NAV*`) · `DXR_LEGACY_STANDALONE` · `DXR_IPC_FD` /
`DXR_IPC_HANDLE` · `DXR_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CONTROLLER` · `DXR_PLUGIN_EXCLUSIVE` /
`DXR_INPUT_PROVIDERS=0` (the #1545 CTS-lane exclusivity pair — they *remove* hardware support
from a run on purpose).

Plus the **rear-depth-budget A/B kill switches** — `DXR_REAR_BUDGET` (`clip`/`open`/`auto`),
`DXR_REAR_BUDGET_OPEN_DWELL_MS` / `_CLOSE_MS` / `_RAMP_OPEN_MS` / `_RAMP_CLOSE_MS` /
`_OPEN_CUE_MAX`, `DXR_REAR_BUDGET_ROI=0`, `DXR_REAR_BUDGET_MASK=0`,
`DXR_REAR_BUDGET_MASK_RATCHET=0` and `DXR_REAR_BUDGET_DUMP=1`. They are read once per
session in `comp_rear_budget.c` / `u_rear_budget.c` and every one of them turns off or
detunes a **correctness** guard rather than trading frames for quality — `_MASK_RATCHET=0`
in particular restores the #1470 open/clip oscillation by design, which is the only reason
it exists. Perceptual policy is the runtime's (ADR-040); none of these is a user setting.

> **Security carve-out — `DXR_ALLOW_DEV_PLUGIN_PATHS`.** It is read via
> `GetEnvironmentVariableW` in `target_plugin_path_guard.c:91`, deliberately outside the
> `u_debug` machinery, and it **disables the #943 plug-in-path guard** — i.e. it decides
> whether the runtime will load a DLL out of a build tree. A per-user settings file that
> could turn off a code-loading guard is a privilege-escalation vector. It stays
> environment-only; the resolution chain below must never be plumbed into it.

## Design

### 1. A resolution chain with provenance

New `src/xrt/auxiliary/util/u_setting.{h,c}` in `aux_util` (which already links cJSON
publicly — `auxiliary/util/CMakeLists.txt:172-176`):

```
u_setting_get_raw(name, buf, cap, &provenance)
  1. environment          getenv_s / getenv / debug.xrt.<NAME>      <-- ALWAYS WINS
  2. per-user file        %LOCALAPPDATA%\DisplayXR\settings.json
                          $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/displayxr/settings.json
  3. machine default      HKLM\Software\DisplayXR\Settings  (REG_SZ per name)
  4. not found            -> the call site's own compiled default, unchanged
```

**Env outranks everything, deliberately.** `scripts/perf-ladder/config.json` sets
`DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT`, `DXR_VK_FORCE_GPU` and friends per A/B arm in the launcher
environment. If a stale panel setting could outrank that, every measurement the perf
ladder produces would silently lie. The same rule defuses half the "a stale panel setting
pins someone to a bad configuration" trap: a launcher, a `.bat` file or a harness can
always take control back without touching the panel.

**Who writes what:**

| Store | Writer | Elevation |
|---|---|---|
| per-user `settings.json` | the Control Panel, via a new CLI verb | none — this is why it exists |
| `HKLM\Software\DisplayXR\Settings` | an elevated `displayxr-cli`, or an installer | admin, same story as `PreferredPlugin` |

The panel is `asInvoker` — there is no `requestedExecutionLevel` anywhere in the repo, and
the only manifest it embeds is `common/dpi_aware.manifest`. Today that is why
`displayxr-cli dp use` reports *"run from an elevated terminal (HKLM needs admin)"*
(`cli_cmd_dp.c:124-129`). The per-user file gives the panel a store it can actually write.

**Only allow-listed names resolve from the stores — a safety property, not
tidiness.** `u_setting_is_managed()` gates steps 2 and 3; an unmanaged name
resolves from the environment alone, exactly as before. This exists because
several `DXR_*` variables gate authorization rather than performance
(`DXR_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CONTROLLER`), and wiring `get_option_raw` to a per-user
file would otherwise have made every one of them settable from a GUI-writable
file. `DXR_ALLOW_DEV_PLUGIN_PATHS` is doubly safe: it reads via
`GetEnvironmentVariableW`, outside this machinery entirely. The list starts as
exactly the six levers the three controls drive; extending it is a deliberate
act, and the Tier-4 names below must never appear on it.

**Robustness.** Parsed lazily, exactly once per process, behind `InitOnceExecuteOnce` /
`pthread_once`. Every failure — file absent, unreadable, malformed, or a low-integrity /
AppContainer process denied `%LOCALAPPDATA%` — returns "not found" silently and falls
through to the next source. It must never fail an app, and must never log per option.
Model it on `service_config_load()` (`targets/service/service_config.c:162-200`), which is
documented as *"Returns defaults if the file is absent or contains errors — never fails."*

### 2. Wiring it in — two steps, in this order

1. **`u_debug.c`'s `get_option_raw()` calls `u_setting_get_raw` instead of reading the
   environment directly.** ~15 lines. Every `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_*` option on all three
   platforms inherits the chain, in every process that links `aux_util` — the runtime DLL
   inside the app, `displayxr-service.exe`, `displayxr-cli.exe`.
2. **For the chosen subset only**, convert hand-rolled `getenv("DXR_…")` call sites to
   `u_setting_get_raw`, handing the string to **each site's existing parser, unchanged**.
   Do not convert Tier-4 sites, and never `target_plugin_path_guard.c`.

### 3. What the panel shows

**"Performance" — always visible, three controls.**

- **Target GPU** — `Auto (recommended)` / `Panel's adapter (scanout)` / `Discrete` /
  `Integrated`, writing `DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` + `DXR_VK_FORCE_GPU`. This is the one
  genuinely user-meaningful lever: it is a **documented supported contract** (#845,
  `adapter-selection.md`), the correct answer differs per machine, and `displayxr-unity`
  already ships a user-facing *Target GPU* setting over it.
- **Mode** — `Balanced (default)` / `Compatibility`. Compatibility is a named bundle of
  the kill switches (`DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT=0`, `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT=0`, `DXR_LATE_WEAVE=0`)
  for the "3D looks wrong — is it the pipeline?" triage. **Presets, not forty checkboxes.**
- **Effective state readout** — read-only, and the most valuable half of this feature.

**"Developer settings" — collapsed, off by default, does not persist across panel
launches.** Lists Tier 1 + Tier 2 levers with name, current value, **provenance**
(env / user / machine / default), compiled default, and a per-row Reset, plus one
"Reset all performance settings". Tier 4 never appears here.

### 4. Effective state — and why the CLI is misleading today

`displayxr-cli` reads `DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT` and `DXR_SPLIT_INGRESS` from **its own
process environment** (`cli_query.c:194,356`) and re-derives the split verdict itself
(deliberately — it is headless and links no compositor). Launched from the panel as a
child process, that reports the **panel's** environment: not the app's, not the service's.

Introducing the store is what makes that report truthful for the first time, because every
process resolves the same chain. Three surfaces, in order of value:

1. **Headless — `displayxr-cli info --json`.** Extend the existing `GPU topology` block
   with a `performance` block: per lever, the resolved value **and its provenance**. That
   is "what a process starting right now would get". The panel renders it.
2. **Live service.** `displayxr-cli clients` already connects to the running service over
   IPC as class `DIAG`, verified by exe path (`cli_cmd_clients.c`). Return the service's
   *resolved* lever values over that same path. ADR-035 D7 already plans a per-client
   health RPC — fold into it rather than adding a second channel.
3. **A running in-process app — not reachable, and the panel must say so.** Label
   app-side levers *"applies on next launch"* and point at the authoritative artifact: the
   single `weave placement:` WARN in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\DisplayXR\DisplayXR_<exe>.*.log`.

### 5. Anti-stale, four mechanisms

1. **Env always wins** (above).
2. **Panel-written overrides are session-scoped by default**, with an explicit "keep
   across restarts" checkbox. This is exactly what #793 Phase 2 asked for on the DP
   override after that one turned out to be a footgun ("persists across reboots until
   reset").
3. **A loud persistent banner whenever any lever is non-default**, styled on the existing
   amber DP-override banner (`control_panel_main.c:550-567`), with one-click reset-all.
4. **`displayxr-cli info` / `selftest` print a "non-default performance settings" line**,
   so every bug report carries it. `selftest` reports it; it must not fail on it.

## Risks

1. **The #1248 class: broken output reads as a performance win.** A NULL-swapchain guard
   made every Windows Vulkan app on the DComp bridge present nothing, and it measured as a
   ~12-point GPU *improvement* (app GPU 8.91 → 4.12, with `dwm ≈ 0.00` as the only tell).
   It shipped in five releases. **A surface that lets users change these levers must never
   show a performance number without an output-integrity number beside it** — present
   count, weave count, and the `weave placement:` verdict. Safest v1: the panel shows
   configuration and integrity, and makes no "faster" claim at all.
2. **The levers interact, and the defaults are computed rather than fixed.** Repaint ×
   late-weave × pacing depth × the scanout split are not independent. The render adapter
   is ranked by dedicated VRAM (`d3d_render_adapter.cpp:189-199`), the scanout adapter is
   resolved from real display topology, and the split engages *automatically* when they
   differ. A checkbox per lever invites combinations nobody has ever measured — which is
   the argument for presets.
3. **Doc drift already exists.** 32 of the 72 `DXR_*` names appear nowhere in `docs/`, and
   `motion-to-photon-levers.md` documents `DXR_DEFER_PRESENT` in four places although it
   exists nowhere in `src/`. Exposing a name in a GUI is a commitment to it; document
   first.
4. **Low-integrity / AppContainer app processes** (the browser's GPU process) may be
   denied `%LOCALAPPDATA%`. The chain must degrade to HKLM, then to compiled defaults,
   without a word.
5. **A settings file must never gate code loading** — see the `DXR_ALLOW_DEV_PLUGIN_PATHS`
   carve-out above.
6. **Per-TU caching** means a "live" toggle on a `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_*` name would update some
   read sites and not others. Tier 1 must present in the UI as *next launch*, never as a
   checkbox that looks instant.

## Phasing

| Phase | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | GPU topology + provenance in `displayxr-cli info --json`, rendered by the panel. No behaviour change. | **SHIPPED** |
| **1** | `u_setting` chain + allow-list; the three user controls; `displayxr-cli perf`; the anti-stale banner. | **SHIPPED** |
| **2** | Gated "Developer settings" list (Tier 1 + Tier 2, with provenance). Wants the panel on **tabs** first — it is nine sections in one scroll column now, and at 250 % DPI you see about a third of it. | design |
| **3** | Tier-2 live service settings over the existing `DIAG` IPC path. | design |

### The three controls, as shipped

Deliberately three, not one dropdown: they are unrelated axes, and folding them
together produces a combinatorial menu that is both larger and less clear. There
is **no quality-versus-performance dial** in this runtime — the defaults *are*
the tuned configuration — so a Quality/Balanced/Performance menu would be
fiction.

| Control | Levers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Target GPU** — Auto / Panel's display adapter / High performance / Power saving | `DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` + `DXR_VK_FORCE_GPU` | Hidden entirely on single-adapter boxes; there is nothing to choose. A documented supported contract (#845) |
| **Mode** — Balanced / Compatibility | `DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT=0` + `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT=0` | Both change **what the display processor is asked to do**, which is where compatibility problems actually live |
| **Diagnostics** — Off / On | `DXR_FRAME_WITNESS=5` + `DXR_FRAME_STAGE_TIMING=1` | Pure observers; they change no behaviour, which is what makes them safe to hand a user |

**`DXR_LATE_WEAVE` is deliberately *not* in the Compatibility bundle.** It only
changes *when* we present on our own swapchain, it already self-disables where
the platform gives no present-timing feedback ("dormant rather than wrong"), and
it is the single largest latency win we have (96 → 17 ms on VK). Bundling it
would charge every Compatibility click a ~5× latency regression on the lever
least likely to be the culprit. It belongs in the Phase-2 developer list, for
bisecting.

**Compatibility's repaint half is in-process only, and cannot be otherwise.**
`DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT` has no reader in `comp_d3d11_service.cpp`, and adding one
would be *wrong* rather than merely missing: the service's render thread weaves
on **its own** clock, which is exactly why the code defines a service repaint as
*"a weave with no new paint behind it"* (`comp_d3d11_service.cpp`,
`witness_paint_seq`). Repaint is what the service pipeline **is**, not a feature
it opts into, so no flag can switch it off without redesigning the pacing. Under
a workspace controller, only the split half of the preset takes effect — the UI
says so rather than quietly over-promising.

This also bounds **Phase 3**: of the levers the service actually reads
(`DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT`, `DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` for its ingest device per #1153,
and `DXR_FRAME_WITNESS`), only the first and last are candidates for going live.
`DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` selects a device at service startup and can never be live.

Compatibility mode is **derived from the resolved lever values**, not stored as
its own key: a preset that stored its own name would drift from what the levers
say the moment anything else wrote one of them. Deriving it means the UI can
never claim a mode the runtime is not in, and "Custom" falls out for free.

## Appendix A — census

Every `DXR_*` name read at runtime under `src/xrt`, with its read site, mechanism, default
and tier. **92 distinct names**; the two `DXR_BG2D_*` knobs reach the environment through
`bg2d_int_knob()` rather than a literal `getenv` at the listed line.

Process column: **App** = the runtime DLL, loaded into the OpenXR app's process ·
**Svc** = `displayxr-service.exe` · **Both** = a shared `auxiliary/` or `targets/common/`
library linked into both · **CLI** = `displayxr-cli.exe` (reporting only, controls nothing).

### Legacy camera profiles

| Var | Read site | Mechanism | Default | Proc | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DXR_LEGACY_CAMERA_RIG` | `auxiliary/util/u_camera_profile.c` | Process environment at the first eligible session per instance (Windows: `GetEnvironmentVariableW`) | Per-executable JSON profile, otherwise qwerty defaults | App | 1 | Inline camera-rig JSON or a UTF-8 file path; seeds instance-wide native legacy camera tuning and Space reset. [Profile contract](../specs/runtime/legacy-camera-profile.md). Excludes display-aware and headless-only/external-only/workspace-only instances; headless siblings of an eligible native session share its tuning |

### Weave / present pipeline

| `DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT` | `compositor/d3d11/comp_d3d11_compositor.cpp:128`; `compositor/xbridge/comp_split_gate.c:52`; (CLI report `targets/cli/cli_query.c:356`) | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` + hand-rolled `static` | **on** (kill switch) | App | 1 | Kill switch for the ADR-037 output-device split. Stage A creates a second D3D device on the scanout adapter |
| `DXR_WEAVE_ON_SCANOUT_DEPTH` | `compositor/xbridge/comp_xbridge.cpp:1986` | `getenv`, per-session | off | App | 4 | Forces the deterministic seq−1 slot instead of newest-ready. Diagnostic |

| `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_FORCE` | same four files, next line (`:4452`, `:5016`, `:6041`, `:6274`) | `getenv` at create | off | App | 4 | Repaint every refresh regardless of app rate. Correctness probe; **will** cost frame rate. Since the #1339 queue cap it fills every FREE slot, not every refresh — pair with `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_QUEUE_CAP=0` to reproduce the old fill-the-queue probe |
| `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_QUEUE_CAP` | `compositor/d3d11/comp_d3d11_target.cpp` (`comp_d3d11_target_repaint_admit`; called by the d3d11 repaint loop, the d3d12 reroute fill and the VK tier's split fill) | `getenv` on first repaint | **on** | App | 3 | #1339: a repaint takes a frame-latency token non-blockingly and skips the tick when none is free, so repaints share the present-queue cap with app frames instead of filling the flip queue behind them (measured 4-5 deep, every weave 3 periods late). `0` = old behaviour, for A/B. Covers the tiers that present through `comp_d3d11_target` (d3d11 in-process, the d3d12 reroute, the VK split); the d3d12 own arm has the same waitable and is not capped yet. **Not active under an engaged frame partition:** all three call sites guard on `partition.next_release_ns == 0`, so at `DXR_APP_FRAME_DIVISOR>=2` repaints present without taking a token. That bypass shipped with the cap itself (#1473) on a code argument and has never been measured; the D=3 arithmetic with the governor holding depth 1 is 60 tokens/s of supply against 20 app + 40 fill of demand, zero headroom, so restoring it is an A/B at `DXR_LATE_WEAVE_MAX_LATENCY>=D`, not a flag flip (#1482) |
| `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_GATE` | `auxiliary/util/u_repaint_gate.h` (`u_repaint_gate_open`, consumed by all four repaint loops) | `getenv`, cached in gate state | legacy | App | 4 | `adaptive` opts in to the EXPERIMENTAL N=2 window ("app presents every N vblanks" estimator; governor-guarded; N≥3 always legacy — five schedule variants lost on hardware). Not default: its intermittent engagement failed the hz30 visual check — panel cadence oscillating 28-50 reads as judder where a steady 33 does not (#1257) |
| `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_TRACE` | `auxiliary/util/u_repaint_gate.h` (`u_repaint_trace_*`, wired into the vk_native + d3d11 repaint loops) | `getenv`, cached | off | App | 4 | #1257 verification instrumentation: one WARN row per ~5 s per loop with real tick cadence, replay/pace durations, and per-gate bail counts. Says where missing repaints went; the witness only says how many landed |
| `DXR_APP_FRAME_DIVISOR` | `auxiliary/util/u_app_partition.h` (`u_app_partition_throttle` in each in-process wait_frame; engagement read by the repaint gate + loop tick) | `getenv`, cached | off (1) | App | 2 | #1257 slot partition: xrWaitFrame releases the app every Dth vblank (D=2..8) and the repaint loop fills the other slots at panel rate with a KNOWN N=D schedule — steady output cadence, no fire/commit collision by construction. **Supported tier: the #918 split (d3d11 bridge / hybrid) only** — verified steady 60 with eyeball sign-off; in-process vk_native/d3d12/gl tiers REFUSE cleanly (fill-loop tick starvation, 17-19 ms vs 1.8-2.3 ms on the bridge; follow-up). The natural Control Panel "smooth motion, lower app rate" control and the hook for face-tracking-driven rate later. Not wired into Metal or the IPC/service path |

| `DXR_DP_FORWARD_HORIZON_LOOP` | `compositor/util/comp_weave_latency_win.h` (`predict_weave_to_scanout_ns` probes it; `po_observe`, fed from `after_present`'s resolve pass, learns the value) | `getenv`, cached | **on** (kill switch) | App | 1 | #1435: learns the pipeline's whole-period offset (composition frame on DComp chains, queued frame at governor depth ≥ 2) from realised flips — mode of the last 32 resolved weaves, ≥ 24 agreeing — and adds it to the forward horizon. `0` pins the offset at 0, the pre-#1435 feed |
| `DXR_FILL_FENCE_PARK` | `compositor/vk_native/comp_vk_native_compositor.c` (fill path of `vk_dp_weave_and_present`) | `getenv`, cached | **on** (kill switch) | App | 1 | #1264 S1: a fill's GPU fence wait releases the compositor lock (re-validated on retake; superseded fills are dropped). `0` restores the lock-held synchronous wait |
| `DXR_FILL_MMCSS` | `auxiliary/util/u_fill_thread_win.h` (`u_fill_thread_join_mmcss`, all four fill threads) | `getenv` at thread start | **off** (opt-in) | App | 4 | #1264 S2: fill threads join MMCSS "Pro Audio" on `1`.

Default flipped on the #1264 Phase A acceptance record (2026-08-29); the D3D11 tier joined on its Phase C record (its `DXR_SPLIT_SAME_ADAPTER_D3D11` bring-up env retired with the acceptance); `=0` restores the same-adapter decline on both tiers |

Default is the d3d11 fill arm (measured winner under real app load — 2.2–2.9 ms fires where the d3d12 arm serializes at 8–9 ms); `own` is the A/B control and the cube-class own-legs arm (its event record did not pass the matrix, so the partition refuses on it). Default-reachable since the d3d12 acceptance — the tier consults `DXR_SPLIT_SAME_ADAPTER` and its bring-up env retired |

Stops a fill weave running between the app's `xrBeginFrame` and `xrEndFrame`, i.e. across the app's own `vkQueueSubmit` calls. On Adreno every VkQueue in the process shares one GSL submission context and no `VK_LAYER_DXR_queue_lock` can load on Android, so a fill can lose the queue-timestamp race against the app and take the vendor weaver's own submit down with it. Measured on an NP02J: mini-window wedges 6/21 off vs 2/23 on, fullscreen weave rate 40-47 Hz off vs 17.6 Hz on. Off by default because that is more than half the weave rate for a partial fix, and it is a quality call. Tier 2 rather than 1: a user would only ever reach for it on a device showing the wedge |

### GPU placement

| Var | Read site | Mechanism | Default | Proc | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DXR_D3D_FORCE_GPU` | `auxiliary/d3d/d3d_render_adapter.cpp:303` (`env_forced_adapter`); (CLI report `cli_query.c:272`) | `getenv`, uncached; call site runs once per app | unset | Both | 1 | **Supported contract** (#845). `scanout` / `igpu` / `dgpu` / index. Read at `xrGetD3D11GraphicsRequirementsKHR` / `…D3D12…` time |
| `DXR_VK_FORCE_GPU` | `auxiliary/vk/vk_bundle_init.c:625` (`env_forced_gpu_index`); LUID resolved in `targets/common/target_instance.c:191` | `getenv`, uncached | unset | Both | 1 | Same contract for the Vulkan physical device |

### Android

All five also accept `debug.xrt.<NAME>` as a system property via
`get_option_raw`'s Android branch — but **not for free, and not for every knob.**

#### TRAP: the `debug.xrt.` prefix strands long names, silently

Android's `PROP_NAME_MAX` is 32 *including* the NUL, so a property name has 31
usable characters. The `debug.xrt.` prefix consumes 10 of them, leaving 21 for the
knob — and **33 of the runtime's 80 option knobs are longer than that**, so they
cannot be reached through this channel at all. `__system_property_get` simply does
not find them; nothing logs, nothing errors, and the knob reads as unset.

Observed: setting `debug.xrt.DXR_FRAME_STAGE_TIMING` (32 chars prefixed) produced no
`[FRAME_STAGES]` rows whatsoever. The name-length arithmetic is the likely mechanism
and matches every symptom, but a direct `getprop` round-trip on the long name has not
been run — confirm that before quoting this as settled.

Stranded knobs include several that matter most for on-device tuning:
`DXR_FRAME_STAGE_TIMING`, `DXR_VBLANK_GRID_PACING`, `DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_TRACE` /
`_FORCE` / `_GATE`, `DXR_SPLIT_SAME_ADAPTER`, `DXR_DP_FORWARD_HORIZON`,
`DXR_LATE_WEAVE_MAX_LATENCY`, `DXR_APP_FRAME_DIVISOR_ANY_TIER`.

**The workaround already in use, and the pattern to copy:** give the knob an explicit
SHORT sysprop alias under `debug.dxr.*` at its own read site, with the environment
variable still winning when set. `debug.dxr.weave_repaint_trace` (29) fits where
`debug.xrt.DXR_WEAVE_REPAINT_TRACE` (33) cannot. Every knob wired that way this
cycle — `weave_repaint_{trace,force,gate}`, `vblank_grid_pacing`, `repaint_phase`,
`app_frame_divisor`, `pin_frame_rate`, `late_weave` — works on device; the ones left
on the generic path do not.

A general fix would be a shorter prefix (`dxr.` leaves 27) or a hash/alias table, but
either changes the documented contract, so it wants its own decision rather than a
drive-by.

| Var | Read site | Mechanism | Default | Proc | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DXR_ANDROID_ADPF` | `compositor/multi/comp_multi_system.c:107` | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` | **on** | App | 1 | ADPF hint session on the render thread; avoids the ~13 ms core-park stall (#646) |

#### Android routing properties — deployment, not performance

These are **not** `DXR_*` environment variables and never will be: an Android
app is launched by the system, so there is no parent process to export an env
var, and the decision they make (in-process Architecture A vs a service client,
Architecture C) happens once at `xrt_instance_create`, before a window exists.
They are listed here because the census is meant to be the place you can look up
*any* `debug.dxr.*` name, and because a Control Panel on a large-format Android
device would plausibly surface the device tier.

| Property | Read site | Grammar | Default | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `debug.xrt.XRT_FORCE_MODE` | `auxiliary/util/u_sandbox.c` (`u_sandbox_should_use_ipc`) | `ipc` / `native` | unset | 4 | The sysprop spelling of `XRT_FORCE_MODE`. Both directions. Device-wide |
| `debug.dxr.force_ipc` | same | `1`/`true`/`all`/`*` (whole device) **or** an allow-list of process names, `,`/`;`/space separated, `pkg*` prefixes allowed | unset | 4 | Dev routing. Routes a **shipped, unmodified** APK onto the service with no rebuild — the way to exercise #1277 P2(b) on a demo without touching its repo. Matched against `/proc/self/cmdline` (a satellite slot `<pkg>:dxrN` matches its package) |
| `ro.dxr.force_ipc` | same | allow-list **only** — a bare `1`/`*` is deliberately refused | unset | 2 | Device-class policy: "on this panel, these apps run out of process." Read-only, so OEM-build-set and not adb-settable on a locked device. Refusing the device-wide form is the ADR-036 rule (a device-wide deployment decision is what the Gradle flavor merge deleted) |

`XRT_FORCE_MODE` in the environment wins over all three, in both directions, and
is checked first. The app's own `<meta-data android:name="com.displayxr.force_ipc">`
is a separate, earlier signal in `targets/openxr/target.c` that a sysprop cannot
override back to native. Grammar is `u_sandbox_route_prop_selects()`, unit-tested
host-side in `tests/tests_aux_route_policy.cpp`.

#### Android weave-satellite properties (#1277) — sysprop-only, no `DXR_*` twin

The Architecture-C weave satellite is driven entirely by `debug.dxr.*` with no
environment-variable counterpart, for the same reason the routing properties
above have none: an Android app is launched by the system, so nothing exports an
env var into it. Until now **none of them appeared in this census at all**,
which made the census wrong about its own promise (`the place you can look up
*any* debug.dxr.* name`). All are read in
`compositor/multi/comp_multi_weave_android.c` unless noted; all default to the
pre-satellite behaviour when unset.

| Property | Read site | Grammar | Default | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `debug.dxr.weave_satellite` | `comp_multi_weave_android.c:626` | `1` = on; anything else off | off | 4 | Master gate for the whole satellite. The woven output is presented by the SERVICE on a full-panel `TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY` instead of returned to the client, so the weave lands *after* the platform's window transform. **Read once per client and cached** (`sat_checked`/`sat_enabled`, `:621`) — changing it mid-run needs a client restart. Any bring-up failure latches `sat_failed` and falls back bit-for-bit |
| `debug.dxr.satellite_scale` | `:639` | float, clamped `(0.05, 4.0]` | `1.0` | 4 | P0 diagnostic override of the global placement scale. **Demoted by P1** (`e777fc6b2`) to a diagnostic — the per-window derivation below is the real path. Set globally it mis-scales fullscreen windows |
| `debug.dxr.satellite_miniwindow_scale` | `:881` **and** `:1211` | float `(0.05, 1.0]` | `0.67` | 4 | The per-device OEM mini-window leash factor the P1 hybrid-bounds tell selects once it has decided a window *is* container-scaled. `0.67` is field-measured on the reference tablet. **Parsed independently at two sites** (client scale, occluder-rect correction), each with its own `0.67f` default — collapse when next touched |
| `debug.dxr.satellite_opaque` | `:708` | `1` = opaque | off (pre-multiplied alpha) | 4 | Forces `VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT` on the overlay swapchain. Diagnostic: the overlay is normally pre-multiplied so everything outside the woven rect is transparent and the desktop shows through |
| `debug.dxr.satellite_shift_x` / `_y` | `:1447` / `:1451` | signed integer pixels | `0` | 4 | Phase meter. Nudges the blit destination by whole pixels. A left/right-asymmetric crosstalk that a ±1–3 px x-nudge cures **is** a sub-lens-pitch displacement, and the curing value measures it directly |
| `debug.dxr.weave_idle_release_ms` | `compositor/multi/comp_multi_system.c:5901` | integer ms; `0` disables | `2000` | 3 | #1278. How long a weaving client may be idle before the runtime releases its lens vote (the OEM backlight service logs `Disable`) **and** clears the satellite overlay, so a stopped client's last woven frame is not left painted over whoever now owns the panel (`91f071770`). Re-read every ~256 ticks |
| `debug.dxr.transparent` | `auxiliary/android/android_custom_surface.cpp:40`; also `compositor/multi/comp_multi_compositor.c:94`, `compositor/main/comp_target_swapchain.c:61`, `MonadoView.java` | `1` = translucent | off | 4 | Makes a runtime-created Android surface `PixelFormat.TRANSLUCENT`. Predates the satellite (#558 overlay mode) but applies to the satellite overlay too |
| `debug.dxr.miniwindow_1to1` | `MonadoView.java` (`isMiniWindow1to1Enabled`) | `0`/`false`/`no` = off; anything else (incl. unset) = on | **on** | 3 | #1367 S9. In an OEM "window reply" mini-window the hosted view re-sizes its surface buffer to `round(logical x container_scale)` and publishes the PHYSICAL rect, so SurfaceFlinger's `buffer->layer` scale times the task leash composes to identity and the vendor's strict 1:1 weave survives. The scale comes from the OEM `getDefaultWindowParamByTaskForNormalWr` test-API, or from the raw-vs-local ratio of a real touch. Set `0` to A/B against the honest 2D fallback (`CONTAINER_SCALED ... presenting 2D`). **Read once per process and cached** — the A/B needs an app relaunch, like `debug.dxr.weave_satellite`. Flipping it live re-sizes the surface underneath an in-flight weave and the vendor's `leia_cnsdk_weave` then hangs forever in `vkWaitForFences` (measured, NP02J) |

**Not a property, and the single most important thing to set before any satellite
run:** `settings put global maximum_obscuring_opacity_for_touch 1.0`. Android's
anti-tapjacking clamp composites an overlay window at **α ≤ 0.80** (measured
`alpha: 204` in the HWC layer list), blending 20 % of the under-content through
the weave as per-eye crosstalk. Screenshots cannot see it — it is HWC-level
blending. The shipping fix is a trusted-overlay or per-package exemption, filed

### Diagnostics / observers

| Var | Read site | Mechanism | Default | Proc | Tier | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DXR_FRAME_STAGE_TIMING` | `compositor/vk_native/comp_vk_native_compositor.c:148` | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` | off | App | 3 | Per-stage CPU timing of the windowed commit; `composite=` is the GPU wait |
| `DXR_FRAME_WITNESS` | `compositor/util/comp_frame_witness.h:62` | `getenv`, atomic cached | 0 (secs) | App | 3 | Windowed count of app weaves vs. repaints vs. presents vs. 3D weaves |
| `DXR_WEAVE_LATENCY_CSV` | `compositor/util/comp_weave_latency_win.h:82`; `vk_native/comp_vk_native_target.cpp:1860, 1878` | `getenv` | unset | App | 3 | Filename prefix for latency CSV output |
| `DXR_DP_FORWARD_HORIZON_TRACE` | `compositor/util/comp_weave_latency_win.h` (`note_horizon`, called from `predict_weave_to_scanout_ns` on the split + d3d11 + d3d12 weave paths) | `getenv`, cached | off | App | 3 | #206 horizon-jitter probe: one throttled WARN per ~5 s with min/mean/max of the forward horizon, its spread in refresh periods, the count of vblank-boundary flips (consecutive-weave deltas ≥ half a period), and (#1432) the closed loop — resolved weaves, wrong-slot calls (|predicted − realised| ≥ half a period) and mean |error|. Pure observer — changes nothing but logging |
| `DXR_WEAVE_PROBE` | `compositor/d3d11/comp_d3d11_compositor.cpp:2383` | `getenv`, cached | off | App | 4 | One-shot dump of the back buffer as the DP left it, pre-composite |
| `DXR_WEAVE_TAP` | `compositor/d3d12/comp_d3d12_compositor.cpp:4122` | `getenv`, cached | 0 | App | 4 | #727 dual-tap PNG dump around the composite. GPU flush + readback; costly |
| `DXR_PHASE_DEBUG` | `compositor/d3d12/comp_d3d12_compositor.cpp:767` | `getenv`, magic static | off | App | 4 | #740 corner-vs-centre phase seed dump |
| `DXR_XBRIDGE_DIAG` | `d3d11/comp_d3d11_compositor.cpp:4264`; `d3d11/comp_d3d11_outcomp.cpp:395`; `d3d12/comp_d3d12_outcomp.cpp:540` | `getenv` per site | off | App | 4 | #918 split diagnostics (e.g. weave-scratch grow events) |
| `DXR_SPLIT_CONTENT_PROBE` | `compositor/xbridge/comp_xbridge.cpp:1994` | `getenv`, per-session | off | App | 4 | #1178 content probe on the split ingress path |
| `DXR_SPLIT_COVER_DIAG` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:10802` | `getenv`, cached | 0 (1=observe, 2=+sentinel) | Svc | 4 | Split-cover (post-black-frame) diagnostic mode |
| `DXR_SPLIT_COVER_DUMP` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:12725` | `getenv`, one-shot | unset | Svc | 4 | One-shot dump of back buffer + source atlas on the first black frame |
| `DXR_ATLAS_CAPTURE_RAW_ALPHA` | `auxiliary/util/u_image_capture.h` (`u_image_capture_raw_alpha()`), gating the capture in every backend | `debug_get_once` | opaque | App / Service | 4 | keep the atlas's TRUE alpha in a PNG capture (default stamps 255, #425) — the only way to test compose-under / opaque-cover alpha |
| `DXR_CAPTURE_KEEP_ALPHA` | `compositor/d3d12/comp_d3d12_compositor.cpp` (`d3d12_capture_keep_alpha()`) | `getenv`, uncached | opaque | App | 4 | #672 older D3D12-only alias of `DXR_ATLAS_CAPTURE_RAW_ALPHA` |
| `DXR_QTRACE` | `drivers/qwerty/qwerty_device.c:36`; `drivers/qwerty/qwerty_win32.c:33`; `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_space.c:36` | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` ×3 | off | Both / App | 4 | Qwerty device + space tracing |
| `DXR_KEY_DEBUG` | `ipc/server/ipc_server_macos_appkit.m:215` | `getenv`, cached | off | Svc | 4 | macOS AppKit key-forwarding diagnostic |
| `DXR_VK_ATLAS_ENCODING` | `compositor/vk_native/comp_vk_native_compositor.c` (`dxr_vk_atlas_encoding_override`) | `getenv`, `static` cached | unset (⟹ the compositor's own answer, `ENCODED`) | App | 4 | #1484 / ADR-021. `off` stops the VK weave sites calling base slot 14 `set_atlas_encoding` at all, restoring the pre-#1484 behaviour (the DP then assumes ENCODED); `encoded` / `linear` force the declared value for a one-binary A/B against a DP that has a conversion knob (Leia Linux drives `srWeaverSetShaderSRGBConversion` off it). **Diagnostic-only and must never become a user setting** — vk_native never linearizes, so the only thing this knob can do is make a true declaration false, i.e. ask the weaver to encode already-encoded bytes (the washed-out result) |
| `DXR_VK_SWAPCHAIN_TRUE_FORMAT` | `compositor/vk_native/comp_vk_native_swapchain.c` (`vk_swapchain_true_format_enabled`) | `getenv`, `static` cached | on (⟹ the app's `VkImage` really is the `*_SRGB` format it asked for) | App | 4 | #1559 kill switch. The runtime must READ an sRGB swapchain as UNORM (a compose `vkCmdBlitImage` converts in the image's format, and the atlas is UNORM/`ENCODED`, Model A) — but it used to get that by handing the app the UNORM sibling, which deviates from `XR_KHR_vulkan_enable[2]` and the CTS conformance layer flags on every sRGB swapchain. Default-on creates the image in the requested format and stages a raw `vkCmdCopyImage` into a UNORM scratch for the blit (plus zero-copy off for those swapchains). `0` restores the substitution for a one-binary A/B. **Diagnostic-only** — the encoding declared to the DP is `ENCODED` either way; only the format the app sees, and one copy per view per frame, differ |
| `DXR_VIEWS_CHANGE_EVENT` | `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_session_frame_end.c` (`DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION`, one TU) | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` | on | App | 1 | #1488 kill switch. `0` never emits `XrEventDataViewConfigurationViewsChangedEXT`. `XR_EXT_view_configuration_views_change` stays advertised and enableable; an app that enables it simply never gets a doorbell, which the spec explicitly permits (`may:` ignore). Live enumerate values are unaffected — that is the other switch |
| `DXR_VIEWS_CHANGE_LIVE` | `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_system.c` (`DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION`, one TU; `oxr_session_frame_end.c` reads it through `oxr_system_views_change_live_enabled()`) | `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL` | on | App | 1 | #1488 kill switch. `0` makes `xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews` always answer from the frozen `xrCreateInstance`-time snapshot, i.e. exactly the pre-#1488 behaviour, regardless of enablement — **and suppresses the doorbell too**, because a notification for a value that cannot move is the reallocation hazard the design exists to prevent. Both vars `0` ⇒ behaviour bit-identical to pre-#1488 with no rebuild and no reinstall |

### Lifecycle

| `DXR_DEVICE_REMOVED_EXIT_MS` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:10279` | `getenv`, `static` cached | 2000 | Svc | 2 | Delay before the service exits on an unrecoverable `DEVICE_REMOVED` |

### Test / dev — never exposed

| Var | Read site | Default | Proc | Why not |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DXR_TEST_SPLIT_FAIL_STAGEA` | `compositor/xbridge/comp_split_gate.c:62` | off | App | Forces Stage A to fail |
| `DXR_TEST_FAKE_DP_REFUSE` | `d3d11/comp_d3d11_compositor.cpp:3684`; `d3d12/…:1136`; `vk_native/comp_vk_native_split.cpp:269` | off | App | Forces a DP refusal on the scanout adapter |
| `DXR_TEST_FORCE_WEAVE_INGEST_DP` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:4269` | 0 | Svc | Forces the #1172 weave-on-ingest arm |
| `DXR_TEST_FAKE_DEVICE_REMOVED` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:3633` | 0 | Svc | Simulates device loss |
| `DXR_TEST_EXIT_ON_DISCONNECT` | `ipc/server/ipc_server_per_client_thread.c:19` | 0 | Svc | #950 fault injection |
| `DXR_ALLOW_DEV_PLUGIN_PATHS` | `targets/common/target_plugin_path_guard.c:91` (`GetEnvironmentVariableW`) | unset | Both | **Disables the #943 plug-in-path guard.** Env-only, permanently — see the carve-out above |
| `DXR_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_CONTROLLER` | `ipc/server/ipc_server_handler.c:167` | off | Svc | Accepts an unverified `CONTROLLER` claim. "Never set on a production box" |
| `DXR_PLUGIN_EXCLUSIVE` | `targets/common/target_plugin_loader.c` (`plugin_exclusive_id` / `plugin_id_excluded`; applied in all three platforms' `discover_active_plugin` and in `collect_display_sources_platform`) | unset | Both | Loads ONLY the named display plug-in — every other registered one is skipped **before** `LoadLibrary`/`dlopen`, which `ProbeOrder` and `PreferredPlugin` never do (claim collection loads them all, #69/ADR-015). For the CTS lanes: on a box with the Leia SR plug-in installed, a `-G d3d11` run otherwise drags `SimulatedRealityOpenGL.dll` → `opengl32` → the NVIDIA GL ICD into the process and the `multithreading` case faults in an ICD worker (#1545). **No fallback on a miss** — a typo loads nothing and logs one WARN listing the registered ids. Excluded entries bypass the #1212 reject tally so `selftest` stays green. Set by `scripts/run_cts.ps1 -Plugin <name>`; not a user setting |
| `DXR_INPUT_PROVIDERS` | `targets/common/target_input_plugin_loader.c` (`input_providers_disabled_by_env`, at the one-shot discovery site in `target_input_plugin_get_iface`) | unset (= discover) | Both | `0` skips input-provider discovery entirely: no provider DLL is loaded, `get_count()` is 0, `create_devices` is never called, hands stay on qwerty. Process-scoped twin of `HKLM\…\Input\ForceQwerty` — an env var precisely so a killed CTS run cannot leave input disabled machine-wide. Second half of the #1545 fix (the Ultraleap provider re-spins its LeapC thread pool per `xrCreateInstance`). One WARN per process |
| `DXR_SIM_INPUT` | `drivers/sim_input/sim_input_plugin.c:59` | off | Both | Simulated-input opt-in |
| `DXR_SIM_INPUT_NAV` | `drivers/sim_input/sim_input_plugin.c:139` | off | Both | With `DXR_SIM_INPUT=1`: adds the scripted "Sim navigation" device (rig role, ADR-034 Amendment 4) and puts the sim controllers on `RIG_LOCAL` origins. Test/CI only |
| `DXR_SIM_INPUT_NAV_HOLD_MS` | `drivers/sim_input/sim_input_plugin.c:153` | 0 (never) | Both | Every *n* ms the scripted navigation pose reports invalid for 500 ms — exercises the composer's hold / re-align path |
| `DXR_SIM_INPUT_NAV_RECENTER_MS` | `drivers/sim_input/sim_input_plugin.c:154` | 0 (never) | Both | Every *n* ms the scripted device publishes a durable RECENTER timestamp together with a phase jump — exercises recenter alignment; CI runs 400 |
| `DXR_LEGACY_STANDALONE` | `compositor/d3d11_service/comp_d3d11_service.cpp:286` | off | Svc | Reverts the service to the pre-hybrid standalone path (ADR-035 D3, slated for deletion) |
| `DXR_COLOR_LEGACY_UNORM_ENCODED` | `auxiliary/util/u_color_encoding.h` (`u_color_legacy_unorm_encoded`, read once; consulted by every compose site that writes the atlas and by both zero-copy gates) | off | Both | #1589/#1610 transitional escape hatch: restores the pre-flip reading that a UNORM colour swapchain holds ALREADY-ENCODED bytes. With it on, sources are sampled through non-decoding views, no private `_SRGB`-view compose target is created, and layers blend in encoded space — i.e. the old behaviour WHOLESALE, one switch. **Never a Control Panel candidate** (a correctness/compat override, not a performance lever) and **to be deleted two releases after the flip ships**. Each component logs one `U_LOG_W` at init stating which regime it is in. See [ADR-021](../adr/ADR-021-color-management-encoding-state-invariant.md) |
| `DXR_VIEW_CONFIG_LEGACY` | `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_system.c` (`oxr_system_fill_in`, `DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION`) | off | App | #1486 kill switch: restores the pre-#1486 single view configuration — `PRIMARY_STEREO` for any `view_count >= 2`, reporting the max across modes (4 on sim-display), and no `PRIMARY_MULTIVIEW_DXR`. Reintroduces the spec deviation and the CTS red on purpose, for one round of field bisection. Logs one `U_LOG_W` when active. 22 characters, so `debug.xrt.DXR_VIEW_CONFIG_LEGACY` is **stranded on Android** by the `PROP_NAME_MAX` trap above — env-only in practice. See [View-Configuration Model](../reference/view-configuration-model.md) |
| `DXR_MODE_FLOOR` | `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_session.c` (`DEBUG_GET_ONCE_BOOL_OPTION`, one TU; `oxr_api_session.c` reads it through `oxr_session_mode_floor_enabled()`) | on | App | #1499 kill switch. `0` restores the pre-#1499 behaviour for EXTENSION sessions: `xrBeginSession` leaves the display in whatever rendering mode it found, and `xrRequestDisplayRenderingModeDXR` honours a request whose `viewCount` exceeds the session's view configuration — so the compositor's under-submit clamp paints the first tiles and the rest stay at the clear colour, which is exactly the state the issue objected to. It also silences the two #1499 log lines (the begin-time `UNFILLABLE` warning and the observation warning on a display-global mode change), because `0` promises pre-#1499 behaviour and a line the runtime never used to print is part of that promise. **One switch for BOTH halves on purpose**: a floor without the denial lets an app walk straight back into the mode the floor removed it from, and a denial without the floor refuses a mode the session is already in — half of this feature is not a state anyone should be able to bisect into. #1510's LEGACY floor is deliberately NOT affected (a legacy app was sized for its floored mode at `xrGetSystem`, so leaving it in a wider one would make the compromise view scale and the mode disagree). See [View-Configuration Model](../reference/view-configuration-model.md) |
| `DXR_UNDER_SUBMIT` | `state_trackers/oxr/oxr_session_frame_end.c` (`DEBUG_GET_ONCE_NUM_OPTION`, one TU; the value→enum map is the pure `oxr_under_submit_from_setting()` in `oxr_view_config_rule.h`) | `1` | App | ADR-041 staging switch for the fixed-view-count submission contract. `0` = strict: every view configuration must submit exactly the count `xrLocateViews` returned. `1` (default) = strict **plus** the deprecated `PRIMARY_STEREO` 1-view arm (an `XR_DXR_display_info` instance submitting 1 while the active rendering mode is 1-view), which is accepted and logged **once per session** with a line naming the fix — released demos submit one view in 2D mode and need the compat window. `2` = kill switch: the pre-ADR-041 rules, `PRIMARY_MULTIVIEW_DXR` under-submit included. Out-of-range values **clamp to an end** rather than falling back to the default, so a typo cannot silently land on the default. The default flips to `0` in the first runtime release after `displayxr-common` and the five `displayxr-demo-*` demos ship the alias submission — the trigger is that shipment, not a date. Not a user-facing setting: it is a compat bisect knob with no performance dimension. Unreachable from a CTS run at any value (a conformance session never enables `XR_DXR_display_info`, which the compat arm requires). Distinct from `DXR_VIEW_CONFIG_LEGACY`, which restores the pre-#1486 *reporting*. See [ADR-041](../adr/ADR-041-fixed-view-count-with-per-frame-activity.md) and [View-Configuration Model](../reference/view-configuration-model.md) |
| `DXR_IPC_FD` | `auxiliary/util/u_sandbox.c:181`; `ipc/client/ipc_client_connection.c:211, 234` | unset | Both / App | #1056 adopts an embedder-supplied service socket. Not a setting |
| `DXR_IPC_HANDLE` | `ipc/client/ipc_client_connection.c:437, 456` | unset | App | Windows analogue of the above |

### Adjacent, out of scope but worth knowing

`XRT_FORCE_MODE` (`auxiliary/util/u_sandbox.c:145`, with a Windows-only second read via
`GetEnvironmentVariableA` for exactly the split-CRT reason described in *The problem*) ·
`XRT_PRINT_OPTIONS` (logs every `debug_get_*_option` read — the closest thing to a
provenance tool that exists today) · `XRT_PREFERRED_PLUGIN_ID` / `XRT_PLUGIN_SEARCH_PATH` ·
`XRT_LOG` / `XRT_JSON_LOG` · the `OXR_*`, `IPC_*`, `SIM_DISPLAY_*` and `DISPLAYXR_*`
families.

## Appendix B — keeping this table honest

The table above is the artifact most likely to rot. Re-derive the name list with:

```bash
grep -rhoE '"DXR_[A-Z0-9_]+"' src/xrt \
  --include=*.c --include=*.cpp --include=*.h --include=*.hpp --include=*.m --include=*.mm \
  | sort -u
```

As of this writing that yields **80** names, all present above. Read sites and mechanisms
were machine-derived by intersecting that list with lines containing `getenv`,
`GetEnvironmentVariable` or `DEBUG_GET_ONCE`, then spot-verified line by line. If the
count changes, the table is stale.
