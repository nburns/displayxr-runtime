# Compositor Pipeline

This document describes the shipping rendering pipeline from app submission to display output. For the architectural decision behind this separation, see [ADR-007: Compositor Never Weaves](../adr/ADR-007-compositor-never-weaves.md).

## Pipeline Overview

```
Compositor                         Display Processor
  app swapchain  ──crop──>  atlas  ──process_atlas()──>  weaved output
  (tiled views)            + tile_columns/rows          (target swapchain)
```

- **Compositor**: packs views into atlas using tile layout from active rendering mode. Knows nothing about weaving or vendor-specific display formats.
- **Display processor**: receives atlas + tile layout, extracts individual views, produces final interlaced/weaved output. sim_display does anaglyph/blend/SBS; a hardware vendor DP applies its own lenticular interlacing/weaving.

## Step-by-Step

1. **App renders** tiled views into the app swapchain (worst-case sized, allocated at session creation)
2. **Compositor receives** the submitted atlas via `xrEndFrame`
3. **Compositor crops** the atlas to the active mode's content dimensions — the atlas region may be smaller than the worst-case allocation
4. **Compositor calls** `display_processor->process_atlas(atlas, tile_columns, tile_rows, ...)` on the vendor's display processor
5. **Display processor** extracts views from the atlas using tile layout, applies vendor-specific processing (interlacing, lenticular weaving, etc.), writes to the target swapchain
6. **Compositor presents** the target swapchain to the display/window

## Key Principles

- **Compositor never weaves** — no vendor-specific display format logic in compositor code. All 3D output processing is delegated to the display processor via `process_atlas()`.
- **Tile-layout-aware** — the display processor receives `tile_columns` and `tile_rows` rather than assuming any particular view arrangement (e.g., side-by-side). This supports arbitrary multiview layouts.
- **Canvas sub-rect flows to DP** — for `_texture` apps, the canvas may be a sub-rect of the window. The compositor passes `canvas_offset_x`, `canvas_offset_y`, `canvas_width`, and `canvas_height` through to `process_atlas()` so the display processor can compute correct phase alignment. The app's real window handle (HWND / NSView) is passed directly to the display processor — no hidden windows are involved.
- **DP-handoff encoding is declared by the DP, not fixed** — DisplayXR owns a vendor-neutral compose space; the display processor *declares* whether it accepts `LINEAR`, `ENCODED`, or `EITHER` input, and the runtime converts compose→handoff to match (a matched-pair step, no-op when they already agree). The runtime never derives the convention from — or bakes a curve of — any particular vendor's weaver (ADR-003/007). Production DPs typically declare `EITHER` (their weaver has an explicit input/output sRGB-conversion control and can do the output encode itself), and apps store display-referred bytes, so the in-process path passes through encoded (GL #407, D3D11/D3D12/Vulkan/Metal #408). The app's obligation: request an sRGB swapchain and store a correctly-encoded image. Full contract incl. the matched-pair invariant and both-direction conversion: [ADR-021](../adr/ADR-021-color-management-encoding-state-invariant.md). (This supersedes an earlier "DP expects linear input" note — that described a service-path *intermediate*, not the handoff, and is the latent half-conversion documented below.)
- **Vendor isolation** — adding a new display vendor requires zero changes to compositor code. The vendor implements the display processor vtable under `src/xrt/drivers/<vendor>/`.

## Color-space handling (D3D11 service compositor)

The DP declares its accepted handoff encoding (`get_handoff_color_capability` → `LINEAR` / `ENCODED` / `EITHER`; absent ⟹ `ENCODED`) and the runtime declares the per-frame encoding via `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR|ENCODED)`, called just before `process_atlas()` — **out-of-band, so the `process_atlas` format arg stays the real texture format** (some weavers consume it as their input format). See [ADR-021](../adr/ADR-021-color-management-encoding-state-invariant.md). Production DPs typically declare **`EITHER`** (their weaver has an input/output sRGB-conversion control that does the output encode). **Model A** (the baseline) sends **encoded** and the correct path is **passthrough** — hand the bytes to the DP unchanged; the runtime never calls `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR)`, so an un-updated DP stays passthrough.

The swapchain → per-client atlas blit is a raw `CopySubresourceRegion` regardless of source format — a shader-blit at this boundary races with the keyed-mutex release back to the app and can leave per-eye tiles stale on subsequent frames. Per-client atlas storage is `R8G8B8A8_TYPELESS` (workspace mode); the multi-comp read always samples the **UNORM** `atlas_srv` (raw bytes). The per-client `atlas_holds_srgb_bytes` flag (set in `compositor_layer_commit` from `view_is_srgb[0]`) is *not* used to pick an sRGB-typed SRV — it feeds the Model-B gate instead (below).

**The earlier latent half-conversion ([#409](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/issues/409)) is fixed**, and the vendor `linear_to_srgb()` curve was deleted (ADR-021 §2 — the encode belongs in the DP). The two models:

- **Model A (default):** sample the UNORM SRV raw → the combined atlas holds the bytes verbatim (encoded) → `set_atlas_encoding(ENCODED)` → DP passthrough. The blit/crop never convert.
- **Model B (gated):** engages only when the DP accepts linear, **>1 layer composites, AND every contributing client is a genuine `*_SRGB` swapchain** (`honest_srgb_count == render_count`). A UNORM swapchain is ambiguous (encoded-in-UNORM vs already-linear-in-UNORM — indistinguishable from the format), so UNORM clients stay on Model A. When B engages, the blit shader applies the standard sRGB decode on **every** output — client content (sampled raw) **and** all runtime chrome (window chrome, glow, cursor) — and the `#1a1a1a` backdrop is cleared to its linear value, so the whole atlas is genuinely linear; `set_atlas_encoding(LINEAR)` then has the DP perform the one matched output encode. Single-layer / non-honest-sRGB / ENCODED-only-DP frames stay Model A (B == A when nothing blends). Verified end-to-end against the Leia weaver (declares `EITHER`); exercised in-repo by `sim_display`-D3D11 (also `EITHER`) and a `DXR_SWAPCHAIN_ENCODING=srgb` source.

The non-workspace atlas remains UNORM-typed (single `atlas_srv`); only the workspace-mode atlas is TYPELESS-with-dual-SRV. Do not refactor the swapchain → atlas blit into a shared shader path.

## Color-space handling (vk_native compose pass)

The Vulkan backend reaches the same DP-facing result by a different route, and the difference is worth stating because it is *neither* Model A nor Model B as the D3D11 service implements them: **the compose space is linear, and the encode happens at the boundary, but the atlas the DP receives is still ENCODED** (`set_atlas_encoding` is never called, so the default `ENCODED` stands). No DP change, no ABI change.

- **Two compose paths, chosen once per frame.** The **blit** fast path (`vkCmdBlitImage`) is taken only when the frame has a single drawable layer, no zones, *and* the source is already an `_SRGB` swapchain — then passthrough is correct and the commands are byte-for-byte what they always were. Everything else takes the **render pass**, because `loadOp = CLEAR` covers the whole target and a frame cannot be half-blitted and half-drawn.
- **Sources are read honestly.** The pass samples through a view in the format the *app requested* (`comp_vk_native_swapchain_get_true_image_view`), so an `_SRGB` source is hardware-decoded to linear and a UNORM one is read as the linear values OpenXR says it holds. The non-decoding views and [#1559](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/issues/1559)'s UNORM scratch survive to serve the **blit path only** — wiring them into the pass would double-encode.
- **Blending is linear.** The pass renders into a runtime-private image (same format as the atlas, `MUTABLE_FORMAT` with a `{UNORM, SRGB}` format list) attached through its **`_SRGB` view**, so the fixed-function blender decodes, blends in linear light and re-encodes on store. This is what [#1610](https://github.com/DisplayXR/displayxr-runtime/issues/1610) asks for; no shader applies a transfer function.
- **Handoff is a copy, never a blit.** `vkCmdCopyImage` between two identically formatted images moves raw bytes. `vkCmdBlitImage` *converts* between the sRGB and UNORM interpretations and would apply the encode twice. **Do not "simplify" that copy into a blit.**
- **The driver assumption is checked, not assumed.** Blending-in-linear through an `_SRGB` view over a `MUTABLE_FORMAT` UNORM image is driver behaviour; `tools/vk_srgb_blend_probe.c` A/Bs it against a natively-`_SRGB` image. Verified on Apple M1 Pro / MoltenVK (both `(188,188,188,128)`). **Re-run it on a new GPU vendor or driver stack — Android (Adreno, Mali) is untested.**


## Per-tile alpha (workspace mode)

The multi-compositor's tile-blit phase respects each IPC client's
projection layer flags when compositing tiles into the combined atlas:

- `XR_COMPOSITION_LAYER_BLEND_TEXTURE_SOURCE_ALPHA_BIT` clear → tile is
  treated as opaque and overwrites the workspace background.
- Bit set + `UNPREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA_BIT` clear → straight-alpha source,
  blended with `blend_premul`.
- Bit set + `UNPREMULTIPLIED_ALPHA_BIT` set → unpremultiplied source,
  blended with `blend_alpha`.

Capture clients (2D window snapshots) and clients that submitted no
projection layer this frame fall through to opaque blending.

The combined atlas itself is presented opaquely to the display
processor — per-tile alpha lets one client tile reveal the workspace
background through its transparent regions, but the workspace's
output to the desktop is always opaque. See
[`workspace-controller-registration.md`](../specs/runtime/workspace-controller-registration.md#workspace-output-is-opaque)
for why.

## Display Processor Interface

The `process_atlas()` method exists in 5 API-specific variants:

| API | Header |
|-----|--------|
| Vulkan | `xrt_display_processor.h` |
| D3D11 | `xrt_display_processor_d3d11.h` |
| D3D12 | `xrt_display_processor_d3d12.h` |
| Metal | `xrt_display_processor_metal.h` |
| OpenGL | `xrt_display_processor_gl.h` |

See [Display Processor Interface](../specs/vendor/display-processor-interface.md) for the unified vtable design and [Vendor Integration Guide](../guides/vendor-plugin-onboarding.md) for implementation guidance.
